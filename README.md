🌲 Early Forest Fire Detection using UAV Image Fusion
📌 Project Overview

Early detection of forest fires is crucial to minimize environmental damage and protect wildlife.
This project leverages Visible (VIS) and Infrared (IR) images captured by UAVs (drones) to detect forest fires early, using advanced image registration, fusion techniques, and deep learning (YOLOv5) for fire detection.

The pipeline follows these main stages:

Dataset Preparation – Loading and organizing VIS and IR images.

Image Registration – Aligning VIS and IR images using TWMM (Template Matching with Weights, Multi-level Max Pooling, and Backtracking).

Image Fusion (IRFS) – Combining registered VIS and IR images to create a single enhanced fused image.

Evaluation – Measuring performance using SSIM, NCC, MSE, and Entropy.

YOLOv5 Training – Detecting fires using the fused dataset and Pascal VOC annotations.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python, OpenCV, NumPy

Deep Learning: YOLOv5 (PyTorch)

Image Metrics: SSIM, NCC, MSE, Entropy

Visualization: Matplotlib

Platform: Google Colab

Dataset Annotations: Pascal VOC XML format

🔹 Workflow
1. Dataset Loading & Visualization

Load the VIS and IR datasets from Google Drive and visualize their structure.

2. Image Registration (TWMM Method)

Align VIS and IR images using the TWMM method:

Template Matching with Weights

Multi-level local Max Pooling

Max Index Backtracking

This step ensures pixel-level alignment for accurate fusion.

3. Image Fusion (IRFS)

Perform fusion using IRFS (Infrared and Visible Image Fusion) to combine registered images into a single output with enhanced features.

4. Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate fusion quality using:

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

Entropy (Information Richness)

Outputs are saved as charts and a CSV file:

/dataset_fire_detection/irfs_evaluation_metrics.csv

5. YOLOv5 Model Training

Train a custom YOLOv5 model using fused images:

Convert Pascal VOC XML annotations → YOLO format

Split dataset into train/val/test

Configure data.yaml

Train YOLOv5 model

Evaluate detection performance (mAP, precision, recall)

📈 Results
Metric	Range Observed
SSIM (VIS)	0.7 – 0.85
NCC	0.75 – 0.90
MSE	Low values indicate good fusion
Entropy	High values indicate rich details

Visual outputs include:
